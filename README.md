# Smart Tab Groups

## The Problem
In Firefox and Chrome, if you create a tab group, and open a tab in that group, and then open a link in a new tab, the new tab is automatically joined to the group that spawned the tab.

However you have to remember to create that group beforehand. This extension takes care of that part for you.

## The Solution
**When**: you open a new tab from an existing tab, and the existing tab is not pinned, nor is it already in a group.

**Then**: this extension creates a new group, and joins the parent and child tabs to that group.

## The Details
No configuration or permissions required.
